# Drawing_with_LLMs
Kaggle competition topic. The goal is to generate Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) code that renders a text prompt as an image which can be scaled in size without quality loss. The project works towards enabling LLMs to reason about abstract descriptions and translate them into precise, executable code.

Model outputs contain extraneous text and require a post-processing step to extract the SVG code.
